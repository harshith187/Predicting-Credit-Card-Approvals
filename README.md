# Predicting Credit Card Approvals
Automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques

Many of the credit card application get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analysing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming.
So machine learning techniques are applied to predict the approvals.

We'll use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
